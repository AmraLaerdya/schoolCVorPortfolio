        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Hi, I'm Patrik Mayer, also known as Amra Laerdya.<br>
            I'm a passionate game developer with a strong focus on both creating and reverse-engineering games.
            I love pushing boundaries, breaking systems, and finding clever exploits. Currently, I'm a student at Paneurópska Vysoká Škola and actively developing my own game in Unity.<br>
            When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find me immersed in the world of video games. I'm highly competitive by nature, 
            a trait that earned me 7th place in the Rainbow Six Siege tournament on YGAMES 2019. While I've since moved on to other titles, 
            that drive to compete and improve is still a big part of who I am.<br><br>
            Let's build, break, and level up together <b>:</b>3<br>

            <h3> Game Memory Manipulation Tool (C# / DirectX 12) or in short CS2 Cheats</h3>
            <img src="images/cs2c.png">
            <p class="project-text"> 
                Developed in C# using Visual Studio, this project puts a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.<br>
                The tool scans the system's RAM to locate a specific game process and extract key in-memory data such as player location, health,
                 orientation, and more. Once the game is identified, the program enters a monitoring loop that continuously checks whether a match has started.<br>
                Upon detecting an active match, the tool scans for all players on the server. Depending on user-selected options, it can perform various tasks such as:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pinging enemy players on radar</li>
                    <li>Automated shooting and aiming</li>
                    <li>Drawing skeletal overlays using DirectX 12 and vector math</li>
                </ul>
